                        Last year, we intentionally avoided adhering to a specific theme in order to 
                        shape a memorable visual identity of our inaugural event. With the brand now 
                        clearly defined, we had more creative freedom in exploring specific themes for 
                        the second iteration of the hackathon. Thus introducing: space theme  üöÄüååüë©üèº‚ÄçüöÄü™ê

                        In order to maintain brand consistency, we inherited the same style guide from 
                        the previous year. But in preparation of the new theme, we incorporated dark mode 
                        into the existing color palette.

                            As a central resources hub, the hackathon website played a key role in introducing 
                            the event and attracting potential attendees ‚Äî both hackers and sponsors. As such, 
                            it‚Äôs one of the largest and most important projects the design team worked on over 
                            the course of the term. Each designer participated in the project by taking ownership 
                            of one part of the website, and we replied on feedbacks from each other to create 
                            refinements and compile into the final version. Check out the <a href="https://2022.itstechnova.org/" target="_blank">

                        Designing a website entirely in dark mode turned out to be both a fun and challenging 
                        experience! The Design team worked in close collaboration with the Engineering team, 
                        who was responsible for implementation of the website, in order to create an navigational 
                        experience that prioritized usability and technical feasibility. We wanted to keep the 
                        website visually appealing and implementable all while keeping accessibility in mind by 
                        conducting extensive cross-device testing and adhering to accessibility guidelines such 
                        as <a href="https://bit.ly/3GilkLD" target="_blank">WCAG compliance checker</a> and

                        One of my personal favourite part of the website was the Sponsorship + Partnership Showcase. 
                        We decided to showcase the information for each organization that generously sponsored or 
                        partnered with the hackathon in the format of space ticket, which was so fun to make.

                        Recognizing that many of hackers access the website from their mobile devices, we also sought 
                        to prioritize <a href="https://bit.ly/3SWx1iI" target="_blank">mobile UX design</a> for this term. 
                        One of the challenges that we came across is the mobile display for the Sponsorship + Partnership 
                        Showcase section. To resolve this, we synced up with the developers from Engineering team to explore 
                        possible alternatives and eventually arriving at a consensus ‚Äî optimizing for a smooth navigational 
                        experience keeping within the constraints of what is technically feasible. This was one of the many 
                        moments across this experience that I really gained a sense of the indispensable value within cross-team 
                        collaboration :)

                        Swag is probably everyone‚Äôs favourite part about attending a hackathon. As a designer, this was also one of my 
                        favourite project that I worked on for the hackathon! Each hacker at TechNova received a wide range of swag items: 
                        from T-shirt, waterbottle, to stickers. In particular, I created the design for the tote bag.

                            While traditional hackathons tend to place an emphasis on competition and feel 
                            like a somewhat intimidating space, TechNova focuses on creating a welcoming
