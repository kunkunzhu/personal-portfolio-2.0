                            Hack the North is the largest hackathon that occurs annually in Canada.
                            During this year's virtual weekend-long event, I collaborated with 3 other
                            individuals to build a digital product within the time constraint of 36 hours. 
                            As a team, we worked together for the first time to ideate the product, create 
                            the prototype, implement the functionalities, and finally present our pitch.

                            After some secondary research, we identified an increasing trend in audio-based 
                            learning and content consumption. In fact, <b>74% of users state that they go to
                            podcasts as a resource for learning new things.</b> As such, we decided to focus

                            Due to the limited time constraint of the hackathon, conducting primary research did
                            not seem feasible. Instead, we discussed our experience with audio-based learning among 
                            the team in order to brainstorm our solution. A common pain point is brought up:

                            <b>Notetaking has long been an integral part of the learning process</b>, however, there has 
                            not been a convenient way for people to take notes on audio format of information. Most 
                            platforms simply do not have a way for users to record meaningful clips of audio content, 
                            nor to integrate these clips into their customized notes.

                            The main functionalities of Voicenoted are listen, write, discover, 
                            and organize. The user would listen to a podcast episode as they would 
                            with a typical podcast app. Once they hear a passage that they want to 
                            take notes on, they can record the timestamps create a customized note on 
                            an audio passage, called a voicenote. The voicenote is then organized into 
                            the user's personal library and available to be publically shared for 
                            others' discovery.

                            Three tabs are created to capture these functionalities.
                            For each tab, a specific design question is asked:
                        </div>
                        <div className="quote" >
                            How can we integrate the notetaking component into a part of the podcast listening experience in an intuitive way?

                            paddingTop: "0"
                        }}>
                            The <b>Listen Tab</b> allows the user to listen to podcast episodes and write voicenotes.
                            Since audio-based media is excellent for learning while multitasking, users will mostly likely 
                            be engaging in other activities. As such, we wanted to ensure that the notetaking experience is 
                            as conveneint as possible by ensuring that it could be done within a few clicks.
                            We imagined 2 scenarios in which the user will be creating a voicenote. Depending on their situation, 
                            one could either create detailed notes immediately, or simply mark the timestamp and stash the voicenote 
                            into draft for later edit (ex. after they finish listening to the entire episode). With the transcribed 
                            audio clip, users can add text to an existing page of notes or create a new page to start taking notes.
                            Audio transcript will be automatically transcribed with the podcast name, episode, and timestamp 
                            displaying underneath. However, if there exists an error in the generated transcript, user could edit it.
                        </div>
                        <div className="quote" >
                            How can we organize previous voicenotes so that users can access them with ease?
                        </div>
                        <div 
                        className="paragraph"

                            fontSize: "0.9rem", 
                            paddingLeft: "15rem",
                            paddingTop: "0"
                        }}>
                            All voicenotes are organized in a <b>Library tab</b>. Initially created voicenotes are 
                            automatically added to a folder for the podcast ep or a drafts area, user can move 
                            them into other places later on. We considered that two of the most helpful ways to 
                            organize the voicenotes are by chronology, and according to the episode it cites from. 
                            Users can automatically load all the audio clips from a podcast episode into one document. 
                            Other than that, one can also create customized albums to organize their voicenotes in
                            the way they desire.

                            How can we help the users discover other contents that might be meaningful to them?

                            paddingTop: "0"
                        }}>
                            We imagined that community-based learning can be facilitated if a user can make a voicenote 
                            public and the browse through other people's notes. For the <b>Explore Tab</b>, user can discover 
                            new episodes to listen to as well as discover voicenotes created by others. It also helps to 
                            include a frequency map to show which part of the podcast is mostly frequently noted by other 
                            users, so that one can jump to the most important sections of the episode. The voicenotes are 
                            sorted by popularity, and a user can easily bookmark a note they found interesting.

                            a warm beige as the background colour and a forest green for the primary accent deliver a refreshing and
